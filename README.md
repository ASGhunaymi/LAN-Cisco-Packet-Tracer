# LAN design using Cisco Packet Tracer

This lab is a practical application of what I learned in the **Cisco Networking Basics** course.

---

## Overview

I built this lab to apply core networking concepts such as routing, switching, and automatic IP address assignment.

---

## What I Implemented

- **Network Topology**
Star topology with a switch as the central device, connecting multiple PCs and a network device.

- **Routing**
Configured a Router with a static IP to act as the default gateway.

- **DHCP**
Configured DHCP server with a static IP to automatically assign IP addresses to end devices.

---

## Verification

- Connectivity verified using ping from PCs to the default gateway.
